      Kurdistan (Kurdish: کوردستان ,Kurdistan‎ [ˌkʊɾdɪˈstɑːn] (About this
      soundlisten); lit. "land of the Kurds")[5] or Greater Kurdistan[6][7] is a
      roughly defined geo-cultural territory in Western Asia wherein the Kurdish
      people form a prominent majority population[8] and the Kurdish culture,
      languages, and national identity have historically been based.[9]
      Geographically, Kurdistan roughly encompasses the northwestern Zagros and
      the eastern Taurus mountain ranges.[10] Kurdistan generally comprises the
      following four areas: southeastern Turkey (Northern Kurdistan), northern
      Iraq (Southern Kurdistan), northwestern Iran (Eastern Kurdistan), and
      northern Syria (Western Kurdistan).[11][12] Some definitions also include
      parts of southern Transcaucasia.[13] Certain Kurdish nationalist
      organizations seek to create an independent nation state consisting of
      some or all of these areas with a Kurdish majority, while others campaign
      for greater autonomy within the existing national boundaries.[14]
      Historically, the word "Kurdistan" is first attested in 11th century
